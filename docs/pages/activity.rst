Public Activity
***************

**Purpose:** The public activity page is a summary of recent and popular OSF projects and registrations.

There are four sections on this page: Newest public projects, Newest public registrations, Popular public projects, and Popular public registrations. The first two show the 10 projects and registrations, respectively, that were most recently made public. The latter two show the 10 projects and registrations that had the most views in the past week.

This page is accessible at https://osf.io/explore/activity/.

Add-Ons
==========
**Purpose:** Add-ons can be used to connect a third party service to the OSF. This increases the amount of storage the user
can make use of via the OSF.

For information on linking an OSF account to an add-on, visit :ref:`User Level Add-on Settings <user-addon>`

Include linking to add-on, overview widget, files browser behavior, file detail page.


Dataverse: if they have multiple linked to their user profile then when the connect the account they can choose from a dropdown (if they don't have multiple connected...)

Users with administrative and read+write privileges can connect and configure storage add-ons. To do this from the main
project page, users can click the “Settings” button in the grey navigation bar. For users with read only privileges, the
“Settings” button will be visible, but options to connect and configure add-ons will not be available. Visitors to a project
(i.e. those who are not contributors on a project) will not see the “Settings” button and will not be able to connect
and configure add-ons.

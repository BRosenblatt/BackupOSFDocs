**Purpose:** Registrations can be created to preserve the state of a project at a given moment in time.

Registrations create a read only copy of a project. Admins can create a registration of a project, and all sub-projects and components
to which they also have admin rights by visiting the Registrations page via their project's grey navigation bar

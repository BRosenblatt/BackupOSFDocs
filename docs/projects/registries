**Purpose:** OSf Registries allows users to search for public registrations.

OSF Registries is powered by SHARE. On the OSF Registries landing page, the user can search for registrations by typing a query into the search box or by clicking a registration in the Browse Recent Registrations section. The search results will appear on the Preprint Archive Search page.

The user can search by registration title by entering the title into the search field. To search by an author(s) or a tag(s), the user should use the boolean operaters AND (including x and x) and OR (including x or x). The accepted formats for searching one or more authors is as follows:

* author:(albert einstein)

* author: “albert einstein”

* author: ‘albert einstein’

* authors:(nosek AND spies)

* authors: “nosek AND spies”

* authors:’nosek AND spies’

The syntax for searching one or more keywords is as follows:

* tags:”multimedia”

* tags:(multimedia)

* tags: ‘multimedia’

* tags:”computer AND science”

* tags:(computer AND science)

* tags:’computer AND science’

* tags:”psychology OR neuroscience”

* tags:(psychology OR neuroscience)

* tags:’psychology OR neuroscience’

To browse by subject area, there is a list of disciplines on the OSF Registries landing page. Clicking a registration type will yield registrations within that registration type.

On the OSF Registries search page, there is a "Provider" sidebar that shows all of the registration providers that OSF Registries aggregates. The user can select a registration provider to search for registrations posted to the provider.

Below the "Provider" sidebar, there is a Subject sidebar that is sorted hierarchically. Clicking the arrow next to a subject will unfold the subdisciplines within that subject area. Selecting a subject area will show preprints within that subject area.

Preprint search results display the preprint title first, followed by the author(s), discipline(s), abstract, and preprint provider. To access the rest of the metadata, there is a down arrow that the user can click to unfold the search result on the Preprint Archive Search page. Clicking the down arrow shows external links, such as a link to a preprint’s journal publication, etc., an OAI (if any), tags (if any), and the date and time on which the preprint was added.

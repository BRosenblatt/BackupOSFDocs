**Purpose:** Sharing a preprint makes it easy to quickly disseminate your work and receive feedback from peers without having to wait for journal peer review. 

Anyone with an OSF account can create a preprint and upload it to OSF Preprints or a community preprint server. A user can upload a new preprint or turn an existing OSF project into a preprint. When a user uploads a new preprint, an OSF project is created to connect to it. This makes it so that the user can upload supplemental files. When a user turns an existing OSF project or component into a preprint, the user can add supplemental files to that project and access the files that they previously added to that project.

A user can access their preprint through their OSF project or component. On the project or component’s Overview, there will be an alert saying “This [project] [component] represents a preprint. Learn more [links to preprints help guides] about how to work with preprints.” A user can also access their preprint through the “My Projects” tab and  clicking “All my preprints” from the left sidebar and then clicking the preprint they want to view. 

Preprints cannot be removed after submission. A user can edit their preprint and upload new versions, but once a preprint is submitted, it cannot be taken down. 

Preprint Details Page
---------------
 **Purpose:** A preprint’s Preprint Detail page shows the preprint and its metadata and is the main page from where a user reads a given preprint. The preprint's title is displayed across the top of the page. The  metadata included on the page is: the date when the preprint was shared, the date when the preprint was last edited, supplemental files, the abstract, disciplines, DOI, and tags. 

 In the top right of the Preprint Detail page, there is a gray box that includes a series of actions for downloading and sharing a preprint:

 	a blue [Download preprint] button, the number of downloads [Downloads: x], and social media sharing options

 At the bottom of the page, there’s a box that reads “The project for this paper is available on the OSF” and has a [Visit project] button that links to the OSF project connected to a preprint.

A user will be able to see and use the green Edit preprint button to makes changes to their preprint and/or upload a new version. Visitors to a preprint will not see this button or otherwise be able to makes changes to another user's preprint.

OSF Preprints Landing Page
---------------

To navigate to the OSF Preprints landing page, click "My Preprints" from the gray navigation bar and then click "Preprints" from the drop-down menu.

On the OSF Preprints landing page, there is a search field to search for preprints and a green [Add a preprint] button below the search field.

In the top right, there's a toolbar with the following actions:

*Add a preprint. Takes the user to the "Add a preprint" page.

*Search. Takes the user to the Preprint Archive Search page within the given preprint server.

Landing Pages for Community Preprint Servers
---------------
 
When a user navigates to a community preprint server, the landing page is the same as OSF Preprints, except for different color schemes and different actions in the :ref:`OSF navigation bar <navigation-bar>`

Links included when logged out:

*Add a preprint: Clicking this button logs takes the user to the sign in page.

*Search. Takes the user to the Preprint Archive Search page within the given preprint server.

*Sign Up. Clicking the button takes the user to a form to sign up for an account. 

*Sign In.  Clicking this button logs the user into their OSF dashboard.

Link included when logged in:
*My OSF Projects. Takes the user to the "My Projects" page, where "All my projects" is selected from you the side menu.

*Add a preprint. Takes the user to the "Add a preprint page."

*Search: Takes the user to the Preprint Archive Search page within the given preprint server.

*User name and image along with a dropdown caret. Clicking produces options:
    
    *My Profile. Clicking this link takes the user to their profile page.
    *Support. Clicking this link takes the user to the `support page <https://osf.io/support/>`_
    *Settings. Clicking this link takes the user to their user settings page. 
    *Log out. Clicking this link logs the user out of their OSF accounts and takes them to the OSF homepage, where a confirmation message will appear at the top of the page informing them that they have logged out succesfully. URL is osf.io/goodbye.

Adding a Preprint
---------------
  **The following describes the upload process when sharing a preprint with OSF Preprints. The upload process is the same when a user shares a preprint with a community preprint server.**
  
Clicking the green "Add a preprint" button takes the user to the Add Preprint page wheret the user must follow five steps to share a preprint:

*Upload: The user adds the preprint file and enters a title.
*Discipline: The User chooses disciplines for the preprint.
*Basics: The user chooses a license and includes an abstract of at least 20 characters.
*Authors: The user adds coauthors, but can also choose to be the only author.
*Submit: The user uploads their preprint to the preprint server.

A user must complete the steps within each widget before they can progress to the next widget. If a user has not completed the steps within a widget and clicks inside another widget, a red growlbox will appear in the top right corner of the Add preprint page with a warning icon and a message that reads::
    
    Please complete [title of widget] section before continuing

The Upload Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose**: Allows the user to upload their preprint file.

The Upload widget is expanded automatically when the user arrives on the Add Preprint page.

The widget contains two buttons with different upload processes for adding a preprint file::

    [Upload new preprint][Connect preprint to existing OSF project]

**Upload new preprint**

When the user clicks "Upload new preprint," a box in which the user uploads their preprint file appears with a message to::
      
      Drop preprint file here to upload

There are two buttons to the bottom right of the file box::
    [Back](this button is gray)[Save and continue] (this button is blue)

The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have uploaded their file and entered a title for their preprint.
If they try to click "Save and continue," a hazard icon appears on the tail of the cursor, and the user is unable to click the button to progress to the next widget.

After the user drags and drops their file into the box, the file appears in the middle of the file box ,where the filename and the file size also appear. 
The user can upload a new preprint file to replace the one they previously added. Below the filename and file size, the message in the box reads::
    
    Click or drag another preprint file to replace

After uploading the preprint file, the preprint title field appears below the file box, with a message that reads::
    
    Enter preprint title
    
The user must enter a title for their preprint before they can click "Save and continue."
If a user clicks inside the title field without entering a title, and then clicks elsewhere within the widget, a growlbox appears below the title field that reads::
  
      Title can't be blank

After entering a title, the user can click "Save and continue" to continue on to the "Discipline" widget.

**Connect preprint to existing OSF project**

Clicking the Connect Preprint to existing OSF project brings up the Choose Project box::

    Click to select
    [drop-down selections][a list of the user's OSF projects and components]
    **The list of projects appearing in the selector are projects and components for which you have admin access. Registrations are not included here.
    
After the user selects a project or component from the drop-down list, the Choose Project box closes and the Choose File box appears below it.
The Choose Project box is still viewable and accessible to the user. The box reads::

    Choose Project (this is a link that the user can click to expand this box)
    [project or component name]
    *Click to Edit*

The user can click anywhere inside the Choose Project box to open it. When reopening the box, the user can choose a different project or component.

In the Choose File box, two options appear for uploaing a preprint file to the OSF project or component::
  
    [Upload preprint][Select existing file as preprint]

If the user clicks Upload preprint, the Choose File box allows the user to drag and drop the file into the box. The Choose File box then reads::
  
    Drop preprint file here to upload
    
The box interface briefly shows the filename and file size (as when the user clicked Upload new preprint), then the Choose File box closes, and the Organize box appears below it.

If the user clicks Select existing file as preprint, the Choose File box will show the files uploaded to the OSF project or component's OSF storage (storage add-ons are not available for preprints).

After the user chooses the file they want to use for their preprint, the Choose File box will close and the Organize box will appear below it.
The Choose Project box is still viewable and accessible to the user. The box reads::

    Choose File (this is a link that the use can click to expand the box)
    [filename]
    *Click to Edit*

The user can click anywhere inside the Choose File box to open it. When reopening the box, the user can choose a different file from OSF storage to use as their preprint.
    
After the user has finished choosing and uploading their preprint file, the Organize box will appear.

If the user previously chose to upload their preprint to an OSF project, the Organize box will display two options for connecting a preprint to a project::
  
    You can organize your preprint by storing the file in this project or in its own new component. If you select 'Make a new component', the prperint file will be stored in a new component inside this project. If you  select 'Use the current project', the preprint file will be stored in this project. If you are unsure, select 'Make a new component'.
    [Make a new component][Use the current project]
    
If the user clicks "Make a new component," the Finalize Upload box will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize boxes::

    Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
    You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
    [Save and continue]

The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.
    
If the user clicks "Use the current project," a growlbox will appear below the two options with an exclamation point icon to the left of the message::
  
    Your project details will be saved as you continue to work on this form.
    Changes you make on this page are saved immediately. Create a new component under this project to avoid overwriting its details.
    [Create a new component][Continue with this project]
    
If the user clicks "Create a new component," the Finalize Upload box will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize boxes where the user will need to enter a preprint tile before moving on to the next widget::
  
  Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
  You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
  [Save and continue]
  
The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

If the uesr clicks "Continue with this project," the Finalize Upload box will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize boxes, where the user will need to enter a preprint tile before moving on to the next widget::
  
  Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
  You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
  [Save and continue]

The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

If the user previously chose to upload their preprint to a component, the Organize box will display two options for connecting a preprint to a component::
  
    You can organize your preprint by storing the file in this component or in its own new component. If you select ‘Make a new component’, the preprint file will be stored in a new component inside this component. If you select ‘Use the current component’, the preprint file will be stored in this component. If you are unsure, select ‘Make a new component’.
    [Make a new component][Use the current component]
        
If the user clicks "Make a new component," the Finalize Upload box will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize boxes::

    Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
    You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
    [Save and continue]

The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

If the user clicks "Use the current component," a growlbox will appear below the two options with an exclamation point icon to the left of the message::

  Your component details will be saved as you continue to work on this form.
  Changes you make on this page are saved immediately. Create a new component under this component to avoid overwriting its details.
  [Create a new component][Continue with this component]

If the user clicks "Create a new component," the Finalize Upload box will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize boxes, where the user will need to enter a preprint tile before moving on to the next widget::
  
  Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
  You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
  [Save and continue]
  
The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

If the user clicks "Continue with this [component]," the Finalize Upload box will appear below the Choose Project, Choose File, and Organize boxes, where the user will need to enter a preprint tile before moving on to the next widget::
  
  Enter preprint title (this is a text field)
  You have selected and organized your preprint file. Clicking "Save and continue" will immediately make changes to your OSF project. You will not be able to delete your Preprint file, but you will be able to update or modify it
  [Save and continue]
  
The user cannot click "Save and continue" until they have entered a preprint title.

When the user enters a preprint title and clicks "Save and continue," the Upload widget closes, and the Discipline widget expands.

The user can return to the Upload widget to make changes at any point throughout the preprint upload process. 

When closed, the Upload widget appears as follows::
  
    *Preprint location:* [project or component name]
    *Preprint file:* [file name] *(Version: [number]*
    *Preprint title:* [preprint title]
    *Click to Edit*

When returning to the Upload widget, the user can click inside the the widget to open it. The user can only make changes to the preprint file (can upload a new file as long as it has the same name as the previous file) and edit the preprint title. The user cannot change their OSF project or component. At the bottom of the Upload widget, there's a message and two buttons that read::
  
    Edits to this preprint will update both the preprint and the OSF project.
    [Discard changes][Save and continue]
  
The user cannot click "Discard changes" unless they have made changes to the preprint file or title. Once the user has made changes, they can click this button or click within whichever widget their currently working on to discard the changes they made to the Upload widget.
    
The Discipline Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Allows the user to add disciplines and subdisciplines (optional) to their preprint to make it more discoverable.

The taxonomy for the disciplines comes from BePress.

At the top of the Discipline widget, there is a message that reads::
  
    Select a discipline and subdiscipline, if relevant. Add more by clicking on a new discipline or subdiscipline.

There are three columns that sort the hierarchies among the disciplines and subdisciplines (aka the *discipline chooser*).

There are two buttons in the bottom right of the widget::
  
    [Discard changes][Save and continue]

In the left column, all of the disciplines available in OSF Preprints are listed::

    Architecture
    Arts and Humanities
    Business
    Education
    Engineering
    Law
    Life Sciences
    Medecine and Health Sciences
    Physical Sciences and Mathematics
    Social and Behavioral Sciences
    
When selecting a discipline, the user must click on a top-level discipline from the left column, and it will be added to their preprint. Their disciplines will appear above the discipline chooser.

When selecting a subdiscipline, the user must click on a top-level discipline to show its subsdisciplines in the middle column. The user can click on a subdiscipline from the middle column to show its subdisciplines in the right column.

To remove disciplines from their preprint, the user can click the white "x" to the right of their added disciplines.

The user can click inside any other widget prior to adding disciplines; however, the user must add at least one discipline to their preprint in order to upload it.

Until the user adds a discipline, they won't be able to click "Discard changes" or "Save and continue."

When the user clicks "Save and continue," the Discipline widget will close, and the Basics widget will expand.

The user can return to the Discipline widget to make changes at any point throughout the preprint upload process. 


The Basics Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Allows the user to add a license, DOI (if they have one), tags, and an abstract to their preprint.

In the bottom right of the Basics widget, there are two buttons::
  
    [Discard changes][Save and continue]

These buttons remain unclickable until the user has filled out all of the required sections and fields. The required sections and fields for this widget are
*Choose a license
*Abstract

If the user chooses the No license option, the two fields that appear below the menu are also required:
*Year
*Copyright Holders

**The License section**
The user must either choose tp either have a license or to have no license. 

In the license section, the user has the following options::
    
    **Choose a license:** (required)
    [Drop-down selections:] CCO 1.0 Universal (this one is selected automatically)
                            CC-By Attribution 4.0 International
                            No license
    License FAQ (this links to the license FAQ page)
    Show full text (clicking this shows an explanation of the license selected)
    Hide full text (this appears in place of Show full text when the user clicks to view the text)
    
.. _todo: license FAQ currently links to the `Licensing help guide <http://help.osf.io/m/60347/l/611430-licensing>`_

When the user selects "No license" from the drop-down menu, the Year and Copyright Holders fields appear below the menu.

These two fields are required. In the Year field, the current year is entered automatically. If the user deletes "2017"
 from the field, "2017" will reappear automatically in the field. To enter a different year, the user can delete the last one-three numbers and type in the correct year from there. If the user deletes the first number, "2017" will reappear automatically in the field.
The user can choose to apply their preprint license to their OSF project. The user can select "Yes" or "No". "Yes" is selected automatically.

**The DOI section**
In the DOI section (if the user's preprint has already been published), the user can enter their DOI of their associated journal into the DOI field. There is a message above the DOI field that reads::
  
    **If published, DOI of associated journal article (optional)**
    
If the user enters an invalid DOI, a growlbox appears below the DOI field that reads::
  
    Please use a valid DOI
    
The growlbox disappears when the user deletes the invalid DOI.

When the use clicks inside the DOI field, begins typing, or enters an invalid DOI, the field is outlined in blue. 

When the user enters a valid DOI into the DOI field, the field is outlined in green.

**The Keywords section**
    
In the Keywords section, the user can add tags to their preprint in the text box that has the message::
  
    Add a tag

**The Abstract section**

In the Abstract section, the textbox has a message that reads::
  
    Add a brief summary of your preprint

If the user starts typing into the Abstract textbox and deletes what they have written, a growlbox will appear below the textbox that reads::
  
    Abstract can't be blank

When the user starts typing their abstract and the content is--so far--less than 20 characters long, a growlbox will appear below the textbox that reads::
  
    Abstract is too short (minimum is 20 characters)

The growlbox disappears once the user has typed 20 characters. When the abstract is less than 20 characters, the textbox is outlined in blue, but when the abstract reaches 20 characters and more, the textbox is outlined in green.

When the user has filled out all of the required secitons and fields, they can either click [Discard changes][Save and continue]

Clicking [Discard changes] will make a growlbox appear below the Abstract textbox that reads::
  
    Abstract can't be blank

**Closing Basics**
When the user clicks [Save and continue], the Basics widget closes, and the Authors widget expands.

This is how the widget appears when closed::
  
    Basics (this is a link that the user can use to click to open the widget; the user can click anywhere inside the widget to open it)
    *License:* [license type]
    *DOI:* [DOI] (or) None (if no DOI is provided)
    *Abstract:*
    [abstact content]
    *Click to Edit*
    
The user can click inside the Basics widget to open it and make changes at any point throughout the preprint upload process. When the user reopens the Basics widget, they cannot click "Discard changes" unless they have made changes to the information they previously provided in the widget. Once the user has made changes to the information, the user can click [Discard changes].

The Authors widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A user can search for and add authors to their preprint.

At the top of the Authors widget, there is are instructions that read::
  
    Add preprint authors and order them appropriately. All changes to authors are saved immediately. Search looks for authors that have OSF accounts already. Unregistered users can be added and invited to join the preprint.

**Search for an author**
To add an author, the user must type into the search field that has a message within the field that reads::
    
    Search by name [magnifying glass symbol]

When the user types in the name of the author into the search field, the user can either press enter on their keyboard or clicks the magnifying glass symbol.

Once the user enters their search query, a gray box appears below the search field that reads::
  
    Can't find the user you're looking for?
    [Add author by email address]

If the author does not have an OSF account, a Results section will appear below the gray box that reads::
  
    No results found.

If the user clicks the "Add author by email address button," the gray box will disappear. and the Add author by email section will appear below the search field with the following layout::
  
    Add author by email
    **Full Name**
    [full name field] Full name
    **Email**
    [email field] Email
    We will notify the user that they have been added to your preprint.
                                                [Cancel][Add]
                                                
If the user clicks inside the Full Name and Email fields without entering information and then clicks outside of these fields, the following growlbocs appear below each respective field::
  
    Full Name can't be left blank (the full name field)
    This field can't be blank (the email field)

If the user enters an author's name that is less than three characters, a growlbox appears below the Full Name field that reads::
  
    Full Name is too short (minimum is 3 characters)

If the user enters an invalid email address into the Email field, a growlbox appears below the Email field that reads::
  
    This field must be a valid email address
  
Until the user has entered the information correctly into these fields, the fields will be outlined in blue, and the green "Add" button will be unclickable. The user can, however, click the "Cancel" button.

When the user enters in the information correctly, the fields will be outlined in green, and the user can click the green "Add" button.

When the user clicks the green "Add" button, the author will be added to the Authors section in the right of the widget, below the user's name.
  
If the author has an OSF account, a Results section will appear below the gray box, and the author's name will be listed in the results with a green "Add" button to the right of their name.

When the user clicks the green "Add" button, the author will be added to the Authors section in the right of the widget, below the user's name.

**Reorder Authors**
If the user adds more than one author, each author will be added according to the order in which the user adds them.

At the top of the Authors section, there are instructions that read::
  
    Drag and drop authors to change authorship order.

In each author row, there are four columns: Name, Permissions, Citation, and a red "Remove" button.

To the left of each author row, there is a hamburger button that the user can click to drag and drop the authors into a different order.

Under the Permissions columns, each author (except for the user creating a preprint who is listed as the administrator) has a Permissions menu. In the Permissions menu, the Read + Write permissions are automatically selected. The user can click inside the menu to open a pop-over from which the user can assign different permissions to their authors. The permissions options are: Read, Read + Write, and Administrator. There is a question mark to the right of the Permissions header. When the user hovers over the question mark, a tooltip appears that explains the permissions levels.

Under the Citation column, there is a checkbox in each author row. The checkbox is selected automatically. When the checkbox is selected, the corresponding author will appear in citations. When the checkbox is unchecked, the author will not be included in citatios but can read and modfy the preprint, according to their permissions. There is a question mark below the Citation header. When the user hovers over the question mark, a tooltip appears that explains what checking and unchecking the Citation box means for the authors.

Clicking the red "Remove" button will delete the author from the preprint. The author will not aware that they were added or deleted.

When the user is finished filling out the Authors widget, they can click the blue "Next" button in the bottom right of the widget.

After the user clicks the "Next" button, widget will close and the Submit widget will expand. The following message appears in the Authors widget upon saving::
  
    Changes Saved!

The user can click inside the Authors widget to open it and make changes after the user has continued on to the next widget. When the user reopens the Authors widget, the can click the "Next" button at any time, with or without making changes to the information within the widget.

The Submit widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At the top of the Submit widget, there are instructions that read::
  
    When you share this preprint, it will become publicly accessible via OSF Preprints. You will be unable to delete the preprint file, but you can update or modify it. This also creates an OSF project in case you would like to attach other content to your preprint such as supplementary materials, appendices, data, or protocols. If posting this preprint is your first exposure to the OSF, you will receive an email introducing OSF to you.

If the user has not completed  the required information in a given widget, a growlbox will appear below the above instructions that reads::
  
    **The following section(s) must be completed before sharing this preprint.**
    [widget title(s)]

When the user is ready to submit their preprint, they can click the blue "Share" button. A modal will appear with the following message::

    Share Preprint
    Once this preprint is made public, you should assume that it will always be public. Even if you delete it, search engines or others may access the files before you do so.

Clicking "Cancel" will return the user to the "Add Preprint" page with all of their preprint upload information still intact.

Clicking "Share" will take the user directly to the Preprint Details page.

**Purpose:** The watchlist provides users with activity information for projects they have identified interest in.

A user can access their watchlist by visiting the "My Dashboard" page and, on the right, clicking on the "Watchlist" tab.
Activity on projects the user is watching is listed in the "Recent Activity" panel. By default, users watch no projects.
The "Recent Activity" panel, when empty, reads::

    No logs to show. Click the watch icon on a project's page to get activity updates here.

To add a project to their watchlist, the user must visit the project they want to watch then click on the button with an
eye symbol on it. On hovering over this button, a tooltip reads "Watch." To the right of the eye is a number, representing
the number of OSF users watching the project. When the user clicks on the button the number increments by one. After clicking
the button, the tooltip shown on hover reads "Unwatch." The user can click the button to watch or unwatch the project any number
of times.

After a user has begun watching a project, that project's :ref:`recent activity <recent-activity>` is shown in the "Recent Activity" panel
on the "Watchlist" tab of the "My Dashboard" page. All public activity, past and present, for all projects the user is watching
is shown in chronological order in this panel. The most recent activity is listed at the top of the first page of activity.

.. _pagination:

If more than one page of activity is available, at the bottom of the panel options to navigate to subsequent pages of the
activity are shown. A left and right arrow enclose numbers that are linked to pages of activity logs. These arrows
allow the user to navigate forward and backward between pages. Up to six page numbers can be shown at once. If the user
is on one of the first four pages of logs and there are more than six pages, an ellipsis will appear before
the last link, which is numbered with the page number of the last logs. If the user is on one of the the last four pages
of logs, the first page is linked to, followed by an ellipsis, followed by links to the last four pages. If the user is
in a middle page with more than four pages preceding or following it, then the first page is linked to followed by an ellipses, then
the page preceding the current page, the current page, the page following the current page, followed by an ellipsis, then the link
to the last page.

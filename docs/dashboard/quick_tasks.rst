Quick Tasks
Purpose: Quick Tasks allow users to perform common actions directly from their dashboard.

There are four tasks that users can accomplish using the Quick Task menu on the right side of the User Dashboard. Each task bar can be collapsed so that the accompanying fields are hidden from view. The “Go to My Project” and “Upload Files” tasks are open by default so that their required input fields are shown.
6.2.1 Go to My Project
Purpose: Allow users to search their own projects.

Instead of conducting a site-wide search that brings the user to a page of results, Go to My Project allows the user to search only the projects and components that they are a contributor on.

If the user has no projects, no search bar appears. Instead, text fills the space and reads, “You do not have any projects yet. Click below to create one!”

Public projects that have been added to the user’s dashboard, but that they are not a contributor on, are not included in the Go to My Project search.

Users can type in the empty field, using the keyboard arrow keys or their mouse to select a result from the dropdown. Hitting enter or clicking “Go” sends the user to the project. If no results are returned, no dropdown appears. Users can clear the field by clicking the ‘x’ on the right side of the text field.

After typing the name of a project, a second field appears where the user can enter the name of a component. Clicking into the empty field and pressing the down key shows a dropdown with the project’s components listed as results—if any exist. The user can select a component with their mouse or the arrow keys. This is an optional field. Entering a component here and hitting enter or clicking “Go” will send the user to the component.
6.2.2 Create a Project
Purpose: Create a Project is the only means of making a new OSF project.

To create a project, the user types a title into the Title field. Titles do not need to be unique. If a user enters HTML, it will render as text. Unicode characters are accepted. No character limit is imposed.

The description is optional. Users can enter text here to briefly describe their project. If a user enters HTML, it will render as text. Unicode characters are accepted. No character limit is imposed.

Users can select a template to use as a base for their project’s structure. This is optional. The user can select any project of theirs from the dropdown, or can begin typing the name of one of their projects to narrow the dropdown results.
Clicking “Create” produces the project and brings the user to the Project Overview.
6.2.3 Register a Project
Purpose: Register a Project allows the user to initiate the registration of a project from their dashboard.

Users can search for a project or component of their own, in order to register it. Users enter text into the empty field to begin a search, using the keyboard arrow keys or their mouse to select a result from the dropdown. Clicking “Continue registration” or hitting enter brings the user to the registration template selection page. Users can clear the field by clicking the ‘x’ on the right side of the text field.

Any project or component that the user is a contributor on—regardless of permissions—will show as a search result. If the user does not have admin permissions, continuing the registration will bring them to a page that informs them the action is forbidden.

Public projects that were added to the Project Organizer, but that the user is not a contributor on do not get listed in the search results.
6.2.4 Upload files
Purpose: Allows users to upload a file or files to a project from the dashboard.

To upload a file to a project, users can select one or multiple files from their computer and drag and drop them onto the dropzone in the Upload Files area on the User Dashboard. Alternatively, users can click on the dropzone. Clicking on the dropzone will open a file selector that allows them to search their computer to select files for upload.

Any file type can be uploaded. Folders cannot be uploaded. If a user attempts to upload a folder through drag and drop, a red text alert appears above the “Upload” button that reads, “Cannot upload directories, applications, or packages.” Folders cannot be selected if the user chooses to use the file picker in order to select files—they can only be opened.

If one file is selected for upload, the dropzone shows the name of the file and an image representing the type of file. Clicking on the ‘x’ in the upper right corner of the dropzone allows the user to clear out the selected file.

If multiple files are selected for upload, the dropzone shows the number of files and an image representing multiple files. Clicking on the ‘x’ in the upper right corner of the dropzone allows the user to clear out the selected file.

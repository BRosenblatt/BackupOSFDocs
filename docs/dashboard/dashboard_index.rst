My Dashboard
============
CHANGE TO MY DASHBOARD

**Purpose:** The User Dashboard provides a list of all of the user’s projects, registrations, and watched projects. It is the central means of navigation to a user’s content on the OSF. It also allows the user to complete several common and important tasks.

The dashboard is accessed through the “My Dashboard” link in the navigation bar at the top of the page; the url is osf.io/dashboard.

When logging into the OSF, the User Dashboard is the default landing page.

My Dashboard
============

**Purpose:** "My Dashboard" provides a list of all of the user’s :ref:`registrations <registrations>`,
:doc:`projects <../projects/projects_index>`, and watched projects. It is the central means of navigation to a user’s content
on the OSF. It also allows the user to complete several common and important tasks.

The dashboard is accessed through the “My Dashboard” link in the :ref:`navigation bar <navigation-bar>` at the
top of the page; the url is https://osf.io/dashboard.

When logging into the OSF, the "My Dashboard" is the default landing page.

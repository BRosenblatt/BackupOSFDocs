Project Organizer
Purpose: The Project Organizer houses most of the functionality on the user’s dashboard. It lists projects and allows the user to sort and act on those projects.

The Project Organizer is the left half of the User Dashboard. It consists of several action buttons that allow the user to manipulate their organizational system as well as a list of all of the user’s projects and registrations.

Contents of the Project Organizer can be searched through by clicking on “Search” in the toolbar above the organizer.
6.1.1 Projects and Components in the Project Organizer
Purpose: Projects and components, as the primary units of content on the OSF, are the focus of the Project Organizer. Several basic actions can be performed on projects and components via the organizer.

To rename a project or component, a user can select it and click on the “Rename” button in the toolbar above the organizer.

To open a project or component and visit its overview page, a user can click on the title or select it and click on “Open” in the toolbar above the organizer.
6.1.2 Smart Folders
Purpose: Smart folders automatically group projects into system-defined categories.

Two smart folders appear by default in the user’s dashboard: “All my registrations” and “All my projects.” Smart folders cannot be deleted or removed. In “All my registrations” the user’s complete set of registrations appear. Retracted registrations do not appear in this list. In “All my projects” the complete set of the user’s projects are shown.

Smart folders appear at the top of the Project Organizer, above other collections, by default but can be rearranged by sort.
6.1.3 Collections
Purpose: Collections allow users to create a customized organization system on their Project Organizer.

Collections are user defined project groups. Collections can house a user’s projects and components or public projects and components that they are not contributors on. A project can belong to multiple collections.

To create a collection, the user clicks on “Add Collection” above the list of projects. To add a project to a collection, the user selects, from elsewhere on the project organizer, the project they wish to add and drags and drops it into the collection. Alternatively, the user can select the collection and then click on “Add Existing Project” in the toolbar above the organizer. The user then can search for a project of their own or a public project.

To delete a collection, select the collection and then click “Delete” from the toolbar above the organizer.

Collections can be nested within one another. To nest collections, the user can select a collection and click “Add Collection” from the toolbar above the organizer. After naming the new collection it will appear within the first collection.

To rename a collection, select it and click “Rename” in the toolbar above the Project Organizer.
6.1.4 Adding and Removing Content to the Project Organizer
Purpose: The Project Organizer displays all OSF content that a user wants easy access to. Allowing users to add existing, public OSF projects enables users to have access to projects that they are interested in.

New projects that a user creates will automatically be added to the All My Projects smart folder.

Existing projects can be dragged and dropped into a collection or into the overall Dashboard folder. To do so, a user selects a project from “All My Projects” and then drags it to the desired location. Alternatively, the user can select the folder to add the project to and click on “Add Existing Project” from the toolbar above the organizer. In addition to the user’s own projects, public OSF projects can be added to collections and the Dashboard folder through the “Add Existing Project” search.

Projects can be removed from collections or the Dashboard folder by selecting the project and clicking “Remove From Collection.” Removing a project does not delete the project or its contents, but removes it from the containing element.

Public projects can also be added to the Project Organizer by visiting them and clicking on the “Add to Dashboard Folder” button on the project overview. This button is depicted by a folder with a plus sign to its right. On hover, “Add to Dashboard Folder” appears. Clicking adds the project and all public components within it to the Dashboard folder on the Project Organizer. When clicked, the plus sign turns into a minus sign and on hover a tooltip reads “Remove from Dashboard Folder.”
6.1.5 Sorting Project Organizer Content
Purpose: Sorting contents by column headers in the Project Organizer allows users to more quickly find an item that they are looking for.

The Project Organizer can sort its contents by Name, in alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order. Contents are sorted within their hierarchy such that top level items like smart folders and any top level collections or projects are sorted alphabetically. Within a smart folder, collection, or project, contents are also sorted alphabetically. For example, a dashboard that had this content order:
All my projects
Kiwi
Apples
Melon
All my registrations
Melon
Apples
Kiwi
Dinosaurs
Reptar
Triceratops
Barney
Snake
Kaa
Nagini
Boa Constrictor
when sorted in reverse alphabetical order would appear as:

Snake
Nagini
Kaa
Boa Constrictor
Dinosaurs
Triceratops
Reptar
Barney
All My registrations
Melon
Kiwi
Apples
All my projects
Melon
Kiwi
Apples

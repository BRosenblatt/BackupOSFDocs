Version Control
===============

We use git for version control. Some general guidelines:

- Use Vincent Driessen's `Successful Git Branching Model <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_ (aka git-flow)
- In your **feature** branches, pull from ``develop`` frequently.
- **DO NOT** merge ``develop`` into **hotfix** branches.
- Follow the :ref:`Git style guide <git>`.


Useful tools
************

- `SourceTree <http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/>`_ - Mac OS X; GUI.
- `gitflow <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>`_ - Cross-platform; CLI.
- `hub <https://github.com/github/hub>`_ - GitHub integration with the git CLI. Very useful for checking out pull requests.

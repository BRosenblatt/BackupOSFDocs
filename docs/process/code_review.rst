Code Review
===========

Guidelines for our code review process.

Everyone
********

- Ask for clarification. ("I didn't understand this comment. Can you clarify?")
- Talk in person if there are too many "I didn't understand" comments.

Having Your Code Reviewed
*************************

Before sending a pull request for code review, make sure you have met the :ref:`PR guidelines <pull_requests>`.

- Don't take code review personally. The review is of the code, not you.
- After addressing all comments from a review, ping your reviewer by ``@mentioning`` them in a comment.

Reviewing Code
**************

- Make sure you understand the purpose of the code being reviewed.
- Checkout the branch being reviewed, and manually test the intended behavior.
- After doing a pass of code review, add a comment with an emoji to signify that your pass is complete and ready to be processed.

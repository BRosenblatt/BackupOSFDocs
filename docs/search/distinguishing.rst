**Purpose:** Results returned include projects, components, users, registrations, and SHARE results. Each is distinguished from one another so that the user can best find the appropriate resource.

Links from each search result bring the user to the relevant page.

Project and component results show the title with a link to the overview page as well as the contributors and links to their user profiles. If tags or descriptions are provided, these are listed below the project title. Options to jump to the homepage wiki or the files page are provided.

If a result returned is a component, the parent project title precedes the component title using the standard breadcrumbs format: Project / Component. Both the project and component titles are linked to the relevant overview pages. Projects that are children of projects do not display breadcrumbs.

Registration results also show the title and contributors with links to the registration’s overview page and user profiles. In addition, registrations are indicated by text to the right of their name that reads “(Registration).”

User results show the user’s name and their Gravatar image.

SHARE results are not shown, but are accessible via the SHARE link (filter) on the left hand side of the page.

If no search results are returned, the right side of the page shows “No results found” and the category filters only show the Total and SHARE categories, with a count of zero relevant results.

Filtering Search Results
----------------------
**Purpose:** Filtering allows the user to remove extraneous results.

Filtering by Category
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Filtering by category allows users to focus their search on the correct content type.

When performing a search, on the left hand side of the page there are counts of how many results fell into the categories of projects, components, users, registrations, and SHARE. A Total category is also shown. The sum of the projects, components, users, and registrations amounts to the number of Total results.

By default, the Total results are displayed. The project, component, user, and registration categories are displayed below the Total category in order from most to least results. If a category has no results, it is not shown.

Clicking on the SHARE category does not filter results but brings the user to the separate SHARE search page with the relevant results. SHARE results do not contribute to the Total category result count.

Users can select one of the other categories by clicking on its title. Only search results that fall into that category are then shown on the right hand side of the page. Only one category can be selected.


Filtering by Tag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Purpose:** Filtering by tag narrows the search frame and raises the topic relevance of results.

When performing a search, below the categories are a list of tags that the search results are associated with. If no tags are associated with any of the results, no tags appear.

Tags are ordered by the number of their results. They appear as buttons with a blue/grey background. The tag that has been used the most among the search results appears first, largest, and with the darkest background. Background color and font size decrease with the use of the tag.

Users can select a tag by clicking on it. When a tag is selected, the search bar is edited to add “AND tags:("XXX").” Multiple tags can be selected. Tags cannot be unselected, but the search terms can be edited to remove the tag filter (i.e. the user can delete “AND tags:("XXX")).”
